# Card

<!-- ðŸ‘‰ Basic -->
::::card Basic

Card component uses [`ATypography`](/guide/base-components/typography) component for its typography.

Moreover, you can also use `.card-body` in default slot to render card content.

You can use `.card-spacer` helper class to add margin bottom to each of its children except last.

:::code DemoCardBasic
<<< @/demos/card/DemoCardBasic.vue
:::

:::details Card text font size
If you pass `text` prop directly on `ACard` then `ACard` will add `text-sm` class before passing down it to `ATypography`. Hence, when you don't use `text` prop and manually write text as show in second card, for small text you have to add `text-sm` class.

This way if you want 16px font for your card text instead of 14px you can omit adding `text-sm` to `p` tag;
:::

:::tip
You can customize the applied `margin-bottom` by configuring `--a-card-spacer` CSS variable.
