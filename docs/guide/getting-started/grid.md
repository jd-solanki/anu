# Grid

<!-- ðŸ‘‰ Row -->
:::::card Rows & Columns

Anu's grid uses [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for creating rows & columns.

UnoCSS provides various utility classes for creating CSS grid layout.

For creating row, you need `grid`, `gap-4` & `place-items-start` classes. Anu's default theme preset provides `grid-row` [shortcut](https://unocss.dev/config/shortcuts) for adding these classes.

For columns you can use utility classes according to your column needs.

With CSS grid you don't have to add `col` related classes like `col-6` to children of row, You can set amount of columns along with `grid-row` using grid column classes like `grid-cols-4`.

<!-- ðŸ‘‰ Responsive Grid -->

You can use responsive variants to create responsive grid.

:::tip
Previously with flex based grid, if you want column content to expand full width you have to write `w-full` to each column children.

```html{3,6}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
        <div class="w-full"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
        <div class="w-full"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

However, with our grid, you can achieve the same by adding `justify-items-stretch` class to grid itself.

```html{1}
<div class="grid-row grid-cols-2 justify-items-stretch">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
</div>
```
