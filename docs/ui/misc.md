    TODO:
    - Create new rule `s-\d+` then provide height & width. This is useful if we want fixed height & width of avatar instead of eye bowling it.
    - In below UI, we have to use important to override card spacer settings. Try to avoid that.
    - If I want to add subtitle at right of title, it's kinda hacky. Provide an easy way to render subtitle on right of title.
    - We can't set height less than h-32 for textarea.
    - Use `AList` instead of v-for + div
