# Introduction

Hi 👋

I love creating beautiful UIs. After building essential components for Anu, I give myself happiness by creating UI out of it. This way I also know how Anu's components will look in the wild and what is needed to improve it.

I am currently doing this as my hobby. I might separate Anu UI in another domain in the future but let's not make things complicated for now.

I hope this will help you develop UIs faster 😇

:::info Coping code from UI
If you are copying code from UIs, make sure to remove classes like `.cards-demo-container` that are for demo purposes only. When I re-design the doc site, there will be no need for it.

:::warning
Make sure to check for code updates of Anu UI because Anu is not yet mature. Initially I will be following what's below:

1. Create UIs
2. Improve the components to provide the best DX and better flexibility
3. Update the UI
